# Ohm's Law Calculator

A simple Python-based calculator to compute voltage, current, resistance, and power using Ohm's Law.

---

## Features

- Calculates the missing value (voltage, current, or resistance) based on user input.
- Includes power calculation as a bonus.
- Handles invalid input gracefully.
- Allows repeated calculations until the user decides to quit.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `ohms_law_calculator.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ohms_law_calculator.py

5.Follow the prompts to enter values for voltage, current, and resistance. Leave the value you want to calculate as 0.

6.The program will display the calculated value and power.

Example Input and Output

Ohm's Law Calculator
Enter any two values to calculate the third.
Type 'quit' to exit.

Enter Voltage (V): 12
Enter Current (I): 2
Enter Resistance (R): 0
Resistance (R) = 6.00 ohms
Power (P) = 24.00 W
